Understanding earth is sphere:
Shadow of the earth in the moon
Polar star - comparing near equator and far
Ships process of showing above horizon

Calculating the circumference of the earth:
https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/big-history-project/solar-system-and-earth/knowing-solar-system-earth/a/eratosthenes-of-cyrene
*we take two places - first without shadow second with skew shadow, we take measure between places(L), and angle of second shadow(A) then calculate
A/360 = L/x

Understanding circles/ellipses moving of planets:
Nicholas Copernicus
https://www.spitzinc.com/blog/solar-system-scale-copernicus-method/
*we wait when planet for observation will take a farrest place from the sun - this position gets us opportunity to calculate: line(main line) from earth to planet of observation is tangent of circle trajectory of this planet around the sun, angle between this line and sun is 90. We know angle between main line and line from earth to sun(main angle), and we can calculate length of main line with sin of main angle * length from earth to the sun(for example 1)

Understanding galaxy not a limit and other galaxies also exist:
"Edwin Hubble in Mount Wilson Observatory made observations, prove that the Universe extends beyond the Milky Way galaxy, universe is expanding."wiki
*observation of size and brightness

Two basics theories for cosmology:

Theory of relativity:
https://www.wikihow.com/Understand-the-Theory-of-Relativity
*
Method 1:
History understanding
1)
1a)example when two observators see one action but on the different distance from action
1b)galileo: "ship travelling at constant velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; any observer below the deck would not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary"wiki
2)
Newtons Laws:
21)when we in "stable" position we need force(F) for starting moving(overcoming inertion)
**Inertia is a word we use when we talk about matter and movement:
    1. An object at rest tends to stay at rest.
    2. An object in motion tends to stay in motion.
    https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/propulsion/2-what-is-inertia.html
22)F = ma
23)F = -F
3)
Michelson interferometer experiment - destroy theory about ether for light(like a air for sound)
*
universe extends but not have a ether(as i understand either must have a direction of extending of universe) 
we can buid Michelson interferometer - with half mirror(45o) the start light splits to two beams and go through distance to the mirror and back to the detector(by perpendicular mirror to finish),
https://www.britannica.com/science/Michelson-Morley-experiment 
undependent from positions/rotations we got same results(splitted beams have a same time, light not lost speed through hypothetical ether expanding direction) 
4)
*Einstein - speed of light is constant in vacuum(also proof of not existing ether)
two theories of relativity: 
41)special relativity
*speed is constant in all situations nothin not can be more then speed of light, changes only distance and time
**when object moves with speed of light, actions for object what object make in this moving system stay the same, 
but in these moving system all actions going through much more distances with constant speed of light, 
=> distances of actions become larger but speed stil same, time for observator from "non-moving" system are moving more slow 
(proof: experiment conducted by physicist Joseph C. Hafele and astronomer Richard E. Keating. Taking with four atomic clocks and airplane)
http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec20.html
42)general relativity 
*mass warps space, objects move through different distance in same time //this is feeling of time
**when you near to gravitational object you have more speed - you moving "faster", but in general you move in warpen space with more distance and have same "time" when you move less distance without gravitational object

Method 2:
Understanding special relativity
1)
Frame of reference - Point of view
2)
Light travel not regardless from Frames
3)
Time diliation - time slows down when object is moving  
4)
E = mc^2 it is dependency in situatuions when we near to light speed, when we have a mass we need energy, 
also this impossible moves with speed of light while you have a mass, and when you spend more energy you get more mass

Method 3:
1)Acceleration a = deltaV/deltaT
2)gravitational F1 = F2 = (G*(m1*m2))/r^2

Method 4:
1)satelites have a time shifting
2)electrons absorb light, and must have speed to not to be absorbed by nuclear
3)change of temperature - change speed of moleculs(mercury - liquid/non-liquid)
4)solar power:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusKlK1L5To
"When photons, or particles of light, hit the thin layer of silicon on the top of a solar panel, they knock electrons off the silicon atoms." (photoelectric effect)
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi2mdbioNb9AhXrcvEDHYQ7BmoQFnoECCcQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgrid.com%2Fstories%2Fenergy-explained%2Fhow-does-solar-power-work&usg=AOvVaw3wFFm7r1BLASYmD4rMEqSm

electron - "quanta of electricity"
photon - quant of nuclear, photon maybe it is wave and participle, photons it is result of working elctromagnetic force in light
quant - is minimum amout of entity
quantum nature - quant is a wave and participle

Quantum theory:

Franck–Hertz experiment  - tube with cathode and anode but between mercure, 
electrons with with rising speed - are have drops in current (lost and reise through mercure with wave form), 
it is showin quantitive nature of atom.

/*temp
"that radiation from a glowing body changes in color from red, to orange, and, finally, to blue as its temperature rises." 
something about quanta(i now don't know what is it)

first things first: radiation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation
-electromagnetic radiation:
--radiovawes(longest waves in electromagnetic spectrum) <300GHz
---it about moving nuclear in electrons field with frequency https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_jYXQFjCmA
---*change polarity,AC, with frequency possible borns waves in just a wire 
---Hertz experiment with spark generator(antenna) and receiver, just ring with("u" form), ring got electricity through distance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDFll6Ge7g&feature=youtu.be
---https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWCN_uI5ygY about dipole antenna and with Hertz expirement(visualizations)
---"radio waves in a vacuum travel at the speed of light, and in the Earth's atmosphere at a close, but slightly lower speed."wiki
--microwaves,infrared - ~same as a radiovawes, but more shortless
--visible light 750–420 terahertz


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light
Certain other mechanisms can produce light:
    Bioluminescence
    -luminiscense with chemical reaction, result of changing levels of electrons
    -in chemistry - exist method for calculating electrons configurations(with table), the energy levels(shells), and they have observations of reactions and it is possible to predict glowing
    -simple example phosphor - when getting light(electrons moving far from nuclear)(charging), then they slowly return to them positions and it is glowing effect(emits photons)
    Cherenkov radiation
    -when light going through medium (light decrease speed) but electrons, whose face with the light can have speed more than the light.
    -"classic example of Cherenkov radiation is the characteristic blue glow of an underwater nuclear reactor"wiki 
    Electroluminescence
    Scintillation
    Sonoluminescence
    Triboluminescence
