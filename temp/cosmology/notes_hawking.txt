Understanding earth is sphere:
Shadow of the earth in the moon
Polar star - comparing near equator and far
Ships process of showing above horizon

Calculating the circumference of the earth:
https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/big-history-project/solar-system-and-earth/knowing-solar-system-earth/a/eratosthenes-of-cyrene
*we take two places - first without shadow second with skew shadow, we take measure between places(L), and angle of second shadow(A) then calculate
A/360 = L/x

Understanding circles/ellipses moving of planets:
Nicholas Copernicus
https://www.spitzinc.com/blog/solar-system-scale-copernicus-method/
*we wait when planet for observation will take a farrest place from the sun - this position gets us opportunity to calculate: line(main line) from earth to planet of observation is tangent of circle trajectory of this planet around the sun, angle between this line and sun is 90. We know angle between main line and line from earth to sun(main angle), and we can calculate length of main line with sin of main angle * length from earth to the sun(for example 1)

Understanding galaxy not a limit and other galaxies also exist:
"Edwin Hubble in Mount Wilson Observatory made observations, prove that the Universe extends beyond the Milky Way galaxy, universe is expanding."wiki
*observation of size and brightness

Two basics theories for cosmology:

Theory of relativity:
https://www.wikihow.com/Understand-the-Theory-of-Relativity
*
Method 1:
1)
1a)example when two observators see one action but on the different distance from action
1b)galileo: "ship travelling at constant velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; any observer below the deck would not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary"wiki
2)
Newtons Laws:
21)when we in "stable" position we need force(F) for starting moving(overcoming inertion)
**Inertia is a word we use when we talk about matter and movement:
    1. An object at rest tends to stay at rest.
    2. An object in motion tends to stay in motion.
    https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/propulsion/2-what-is-inertia.html
22)F = ma
23)F = -F
3)
Michelson interferometer experiment - destroy theory about ether for light(like a air for sound)
*
universe extends but not have a ether(as i understand either must have a direction of extending of universe) 
we can buid Michelson interferometer - with half mirror(45o) the start light splits to two beams and go through distance to the mirror and back to the detector(by perpendicular mirror to finish),
https://www.britannica.com/science/Michelson-Morley-experiment 
undependent from positions/rotations we got same results(splitted beams have a same time, light not lost speed through hypothetical ether expanding direction) 
4)
*Einstein - speed of light is constant in vacuum(also proof of not existing ether)
two theories of relativity: 
//temp:
41)special relativity
*speed is constant in all situations nothin not can be more then speed of light, changes only distance and time
**when we move with speed of light, actions for us what we make in this moving system stay the same, 
but in these moving system all actions going through much more distances with constant speed of light, 
=> distances of actions become larger but speed stil same, time for observator from "non-moving" system are moving more slow 
***E = mc^2 it is dependency in situatuions when we near to light speed, when we have a mass we need energy, 
also this impossible moves with speed of light while you have a mass, and when you spend more energy you get more mass
http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec20.html
42)general relativity 
*mass warps space, objects move through different distance in same time //this is feeling of time
**when you near to gravitational object you have more speed - you moving "faster", but in general you move in warpen space with more distance and have same "time" when you move less distance without gravitational object
