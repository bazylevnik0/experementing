goal(just connect acer to bluettoth network):

in acer very old wireless card and i got from ali usb bluetooth module: 
yep very cheap, but in ubuntu(acer) it is shows(lsusb) like a Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle( HCI mode)
if just plug in and trying turn on through GNOME control(default BT manager) - it is not working
also with dmesg | grep -i bluetooth i got this log: "unbranded csr clone detected ubuntu"
*i found some solutions with patchs of kernel but not tried it: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/637599/bluetooth-dongle-drivers/656676#656676

i installed:
-"bluez" - as i understand it is bunch of tools(also stack for "blueman") for working with bluetooth
https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/bluez/reference/commands
it is have bluetoothctl(command "list" in ctl not showing any controllers)
and tools for working with HCI(https://manpages.debian.org/testing/bluez/hcitool.1.en.html)
-"blueman" GTK bluetooth manager(when was first launch - show something, but then failure when relaunching)
-and "bluetooth" (also blue-z, obex, something about supporting bluetooth)

*something usefull for reading https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth
